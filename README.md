# Modulate and Commit I

Composition for organs and electronics.

## Setup:

As many organs, or organ like instruments as available have to be accessible by
all players.

## Instructions

All players are asked to tune in the first chord together. Any accesible
parameter is up for grabs. ðŸ¦€

When the group commits to their modulation, a random player is asked to modulate
the next chord in the sequence. If the player commits again, the process is
repeated until the end of the sequence.

## Pre-Conditions:

This is the chord sequence.

Dm, C, Eb, Dm, Em, F, EM , F, G, Am, Bb, Dm, Dmadd2, Dm, C, Eb, D, Em, F, Em, F,
G, Am, Bb, Dm

Minimum numbers of players 2, maximum number of players should not exceed the
maximum count of chords in the sequence, but we recommend to not involve more
than 7 players (dwarf preferably)
